'''
Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity
and with the smallest space complexity possible.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
-5 * 104 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104

Summary/Explanation:

We are given an array of integers and want to sort it in ascending order and then return it.
We cannot use any built-in sorting function. We should use a mergeSort algorithm for this.s
