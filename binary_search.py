'''
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order,
and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. 
If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.

Summary/Explaination:

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and a target.
The function should return the index of the target from the array.
If the target does not exist in the array return -1
