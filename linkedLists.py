'''
There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.

You are given the node to be deleted node. You will not be given access to the first node of head.

All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node node is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
All the values before node should be in the same order.
All the values after node should be in the same order.

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [2, 1000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
The value of each node in the list is unique.
The node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node.

Psuedocode planning

To remove a node from the linked list we should first find our node by iterating through the
linkedList to find the node we are deleting. When we find our node, we assign the next of
the previous node to the next of the node after our current node.
